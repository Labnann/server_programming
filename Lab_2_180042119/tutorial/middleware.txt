function (req,res,next)
middleware can- execute any code
              - can change req/res or end its cycle
              - can call any other middleware
              - can redirect a user to a particular page based on the req
5 types:
1. application level middleware => app.use()[page not found] signature:req/res/next
2. router level middleware => router.use() based on the req on that route it redirects to somewhere else  signature:req/res/next
3. error handling middleware => sends a particular response code or file. it has [req,res,next,err]
4. built in middleware => bodyparser.json/urlencoded it checks if it has any default json data. we can then use that data bcz we use built in middleware
                       => styling
5. 3rd party middleware => to track the response time, we can use 3rd party middleware(Morgan)
